What better way to start my blog by writing _test post please ignore_? Alright, strap in kids, time for a little reddit history.

See, once upon a time, there was a post called _Test Post Please Ignore_ in reddit, and somehow got upvoted to the moon. No, that'd be an understatement. It got so many upvotes that it went straight to the sun, punched a hole through it, tore open a wormhole, and ended up in a parallel dimension stuck in the buttocks of an unfortunate elder god. Our universe is fucked because of this, but hey, it'll be some time before the elder god arrives, but when it does, just remember:

It was reddit's fault.
